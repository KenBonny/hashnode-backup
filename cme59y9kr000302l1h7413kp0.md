Phew, that was a lot. I'm always surprised how simple solutions contain so much detail and nuance when I try to explain them. I hope I conveyed the message that A-Frame simplifies code within a module or class by separating the infrastructure components and logic components. They will interact with each other through a controller that knows how to connect one to the other. Keep logic focused on the feature and try to keep infrastructure as straightforward as possible.

Good luck out there!
