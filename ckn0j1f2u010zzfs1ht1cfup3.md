It's been one hell of a year, one none of us will ever forget. I really hope it will be because of all the wonderful times humanity showed us it's shining side. The times friends, family and strangers showed compassion and sympathy.

At the end of the year, I'd like to look back at what I did this past year. It's not as much as the past few years. My blogging was not that much, I wrote a few articles at the start of this year. Then I had a bit of a down period. Not just because of lil' old Corona, but also because I sold my last house and moved into another one. That took up a considerable amount of my time. I have also switched projects, which was a bit sudden (and stressful). I did come out in a better environment, if I say so myself. I have tried to keep sporting, but it's been a challenge to motivate myself. Going to a sports club really does wonders for my motivation, but they had to shut down for the time being.

From the bottom of my heart, I hope next year will be gentler, calmer and filled with joyous reunions of friends and loved ones. Because right now, they are in my thoughts (and Zoom calls), but unfortunately not close enough to share a laugh over a drink. Except for my loving and supporting wife, who's now constantly by my side as we both work from home.

I hope that everybody who reads this has their family, whomever they are, close by. So enjoy the holidays as best as you can and I'll see you next year. Fit and fresh to get vaccinated and pick life back up where we left it a year ago.

Happy new year, everybody!
