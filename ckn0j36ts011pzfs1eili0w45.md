A while ago, I added support for [Areas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/areas?view=aspnetcore-2.1) to the AddFeatureFolders Nuget maintained by [Scott Allen](https://twitter.com/OdeToCode)Â and I [wrote](http://kenbonny.net/2018/03/12/contributing-to-addfeaturefolders-package/) about what I build. Now I've improved how the Nuget finds features in areas that reside in sub folders. So check out the newest version of the [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OdeToCode.AddFeatureFolders/) to take advantage of deeper feature folder support for areas.
