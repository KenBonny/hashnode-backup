It's that wonderful time of the year again.Â Of course I'm talking about the holiday season, the season to be merry and the season I have no time to do anything else besides work and go to a ton of parties from friends, family and coworkers.

Last week there was no blog post because I didn't have enough time to finish it and I did not want to publish a post which I knew was of sub-par quality. In the past week, I haven't had the time to finish the post either because of other appointments, both personal and work related.

Unfortunately, my agenda is not looking better in the next two weeks. That is why I'm taking a two week break to get through my busy schedule of food induced coma's and pounding headaches.

Hopefully you will all have equally fun holiday periods and I'll see you in the new year.
