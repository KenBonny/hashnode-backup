During a very fun NDC Oslo, I got to talk to the awesome guys at [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/). Because I'm writing nice things about their newest IDE [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), I get to give away a code for a 3 month JetBrains All Product Pack subscription to one of my readers!

Because JetBrains makes good tools, I think I'm going to receive a lot of [tweets](https://twitter.com/bonny_ken) about this. To make it easier to make a decision, I hope to receive funny, inspirational or heartwarming messages on why these tools will improve your quality of life and code.
