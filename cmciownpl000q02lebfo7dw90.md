In my last projects, I’ve been using the same approach with great success. It has simplified my code, my tests and the project’s setup. In the following blog posts, I’m going to talk about A-Frame Architecture: what it is, how I use it, how to tackle more complex scenarios and which frameworks and tools help me in this process.

I will be using a demo project to illustrate these concepts. The app will help dog walkers record their routes, which dogs they took on each walk and which friends they met along the way.

Seeing as this is a demo app, I will use a basic coordinate system instead of GPS data. This will simplify the code and keep the focus on the techniques instead of going into unnecessary details of the non-existent business domain. For brevity, I'll assume you’re familiar with popular concepts such as setting up Entity Framework or how to correctly use `HttpClient`. There are numerous articles explaining those topics in more depth. I want to keep A-Frame architecture front and centre.

If you want to skip ahead, my [GitHub repository with the same name](https://github.com/KenBonny/A-Frame-Mazing-Architecture) contains all the source code used in the following posts. I’ve also found a [blog book (too long to be called a post) from James Shore](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/nullables/testing-without-mocks#a-frame-arch) that expands immensely on my idea. I’ve also drawn inspiration from that work to enhance my learning process, so I encourage you to check it out.

Let’s get started with explaining what A-Frame architecture is.
