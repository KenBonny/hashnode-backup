Me and my wife have been together for almost 7 years now, 3 of which we are married. I'd like to dedicate this post to my beautiful and loving wife.

You, dear reader, might not know this, but besides cooking delicious meals, looking like a princess and supporting me in every endeavour I undertake, she also proofreads every article I write. She's the reason you read this without spelling errors,  is all in the correct tense and reads nicely.

She does all this while studying for a GDPR course so she can make her company compliant. The course has been taxing because the work load is huge. She has to write a paper on a fictional multinational and do the same for her actual company. So she has a double work load next to her normal responsibilities. Yet she finds a way to do all this work, makes dinner and still has time to play video games with me. She makes it look so easy too.

Today is her birthday and I wanted to surprise her by letting the world (or at least my loyal readers) know how much I love and cherish her.

So when you read this, Kelly Alix, know that I love you with all my heart.

P.S. If you want to wish her a happy bithday, you can do so on [her twitter](https://twitter.com/KellyAlix).
