Recently I went to a session given by [Maarten Balliauw](https://blog.maartenballiauw.be) about memory management. In that talk, he mentioned the effect [boxing and unboxing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yz2be5wk.aspx) has on performance. He also talked about how a lot of strings can affect memory management. This got me thinking on the impact of boxing and unboxing when I format strings. What kind of impact does it have?

Boxing is when a value type is wrapped inside a reference type. An example of this is when an `integer` gets assigned to an `object`. How many times would that happen when you format a `string`? I think it happens a lot. I can't rememer how many times I've written `string.Format("explanation: {0}", 0)` without giving it much thought. The 0 would be in a variable such as age or percentage. I would just give it to the formatting function and be done with it.

What happens is that the `integer` value type is boxed into an `object` reference type so it can be passed to the `Format` function. To insert the `integer` into the text, unboxing needs to happen first. This is the process of converting the `object` back to its original value type. This takes quite a bit of processing time. When the unboxing is done, the value can be represented as a `string` and inserted into the correct position in the text.

If I call the `ToString` method myself, I convert the value type to a reference type (yes, string is a reference type). A reference type can easily be assigned to another reference type if it's in the hierarchy of the most specific type. Since every reference type in C# inherits from `object`, this can happen very efficiently. Thus saving the processor a lot of work.

Now, I want to know the difference a `ToString()` call would make on the performance of a string format with a value type. So I set up a number of tests that all follow the same pattern. Per `string` concatenation, I have two tests that do a single string format: one with a call to `ToString()` and one without. Then I have two similar tests but they repeat the operation a million times.

```
[Fact]
public void Single_Append_without_ToString()
{
    var i = 1;
    var format = new StringBuilder("Number: ").Append(i.ToString()).ToString();
}
[Fact]
public void Million_Append_without_ToString()
{
    for (var i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++)
    {
        var format = new StringBuilder("Number: ").Append(i.ToString()).ToString();
    }
}
```

In the tests that box the value, I remove the call to \`\`ToString\`\`\`, so I won't bore you with that code. If you do want to check out my full setup, head over to my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/KenBonny/StringFormatBoxingExperiment) to see all code. I even put all the test results in a convenient Excel spreadsheet. Mainly so I could easily compare the results myself.

The `string` concatenations I tested are the static `Format` method, interpolation, the `Append` function of `StringBuilder` and a good old-fashioned `string` summation (`"append " + "text"`).

Before I delve into the results, I have to display them as [ticks](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.timespan.ticks(v=vs.110).aspx). When I printed out the elapsed milliseconds, I didn't have enough granularity so some tests both showed 1ms had elapsed and I couldn't compare the two properly.

So, on to the results. The first thing that popped out is that adding the `ToString` method does make an impact. In the single concatenation, the biggest difference goes to the `Format` concatenation. With `ToString` it takes 1400 ticks and with boxing (not using `ToString`) it takes a whopping 215 000 ticks. That is over 15 000% increase in time. Let that sink in for a minute.

The other single concatenations aren't that big apart, but the effect is noticeable. For example, the next biggest difference is interpolation where the boxing takes almost 1600 ticks and using `ToString` takes about 800 ticks. Boxing doubles the time it takes. The `StringBuilder` difference is about 80 ticks apart  and the summation a good 10 ticks. In every situation, the boxing loses to the manual `ToString`.

That does not mean the difference when iterating a million times cannot have an impact. Again, all the methods that use `ToString` are faster than their boxing counterpart. The slowest `ToString` method is the interpolation, which takes almost 2 352 000 ticks. The fastest boxing method is the `StringBuilder` which takes approximately 2 418 000 ticks.

The fastest processing a million is the summation where `ToString` is used. That takes just over 1 370 000 ticks to complete. Second place goes to the `StringBuilder` with just under 2 000 000 ticks.

Another remarkable change is between the fastest single concatenation that uses `ToString`, which is the interpolation method. But when iterating over a million times, it becomes the slowest concatenation method, loosing to all other concatenation methods that use `ToString`.

After performing these tests, I was quite surprised how much a performance impact boxing has on both single and batch processing. This is something I (and you too) should keep in mind when writing software. Especially since `string.Format()` is so widely used and I rarely see parameters being cast to `string` manually. Resharper even discourages the use of `ToString` in concatenation. For reference types, I don't think there is a lot of speed to gain, but value types can improve performance drastically. I thought the compiler could and would optimise a lot of this, but unfortunately, it's not that smart yet.
